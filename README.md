## Main files\*

The main pdf viewer currently working are `pages/viewPdf.tsx` & `pages/viewLocalPDF.tsx`

1. `viewPdf.tsx` views the PDF file from an external URL.
2. `viewLocalPDF.tsx` views the PDF file from local directories.

Use whichever is suitable for the project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
